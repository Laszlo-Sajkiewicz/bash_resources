This repo is to help with the setup of an amenable BASH environment.
I find that often I am on a foriegn machine that I wish I could
quickly setup.  Keeping this repo of a bash environment setup allows
me to keep files consistent and quickly configure new environments.

All the bash goodies under one "roof" also included installer (setup) script

INSTALLATION:

%> cd ~/
%> git clone https://github.com/gavinmbell/bash_resources ~/.bash_resources
%> cd .bash_resources
%> ./setup
%> source ~/.bashrc

Type:
%> src

(smile)

I should have done this a long time ago...
